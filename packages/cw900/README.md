# CW900 Spec: Staking Interface

CW900 is a specification for staking tokens based on CosmWasm.
The name and design is loosely based on Ethereum's ERC900 standard,
but many changes have been made. The types in here can be imported by
contracts that wish to implement this  spec, or by contracts that call
to any standard cw20 contract.
